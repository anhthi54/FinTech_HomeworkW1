## Recommendations

* One of the payment trend is buy now and pay later. It is also more useful for small businesses who have cashflow issue as they could not access to longer payment term with their suppliers but need to give long credit term for customers. Square is interested in this kind of payment, therefore it has been aquired Afterpay. Square should provide buy now pay later to small business as a package when they use the current Square POS.

* Most of small businesses are facing the cashflow issue and they are paying a huge money to factoring companies such as Scottish Pacific. It is more expensive for small businesses to access to loan of trade finance becasue they need to pay professional finance officer to prepare all the paperwork and prove the payback capacity. There is a need "by now pay later" in small and medium businesses and most of Square customers are small companies. Therefore, Square can easily provide the package for both mobile payment service and "buy now pay later". By doing so, Square can attract more customers and gain revenue from short term finance to these customers. 

* To implement the service, Square needs to develop an application to control the limit of the short-term loan given to customers under "buy now pay later". There is also a quick credit check process which can return the result quickly so customers can apply and access to the service within minutes. Ease-of-use and speed are very important in this kind of service to get the competitive advantage.
